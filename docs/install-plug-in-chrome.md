## Load the Extension

With `developer mode` enabled, you need to load the extension. Either by dragging the downloaded plug zip file into chrome or by explicitly unzipping the download and using the `load unpacked` button.

To drag the downloaded plug zip file: open the download folder, find the plug zip file and drag it over the chrome extensions page in the Chrome window.

Alternatively, to explicitly load via the `load unpacked` button: open the download folder, find the plug zip file, extract its contents to a folder, then in the chrome extensions page click on the `Load unpacked` button and select the unzipped folder.
